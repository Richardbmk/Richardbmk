_Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Ricardo (Richard for the friends), My academic background is in Energy Engineer but I consider myself a person who like to think ahead with the idea of trying to face the needs of tomorrow. College was little bit out to date to me that‚Äôs why I choose to acquire by myself some knowledge related with Industry 4.0 like cloud computing.  
I think of programming as a set of tools... Tools which I can bring to life my own ideas._

**And what could be more fun that bringing ideas to life? üå±**
